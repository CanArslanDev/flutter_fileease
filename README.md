### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.1.5)
- Dart SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Firebase account
- Git


## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure that Flutter is installed on your machine. [Download Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Firebase Account**: You need a Firebase account and a project set up to connect the app.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/CanArslanDev/flutter_iot_energy.git
cd flutter_iot_energy
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary Flutter packages:

```
flutter pub get
```

## 3. Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project, and add an Android/iOS app.
2. Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and place it in `android/app`. For iOS, download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `ios/Runner`.
3. In Firebase, enable **Firestore** for data storage and **Authentication** for user management.

## 4. Configure FlutterFire

Run this command to link Firebase to your Flutter project:

```
flutterfire configure
```

## 5. CORS Configuration for Web

To enable Firebase functionality for your Flutter web app, you may need to adjust CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings to avoid issues with requests from different origins.

Follow these steps to configure Firebase CORS settings for your Flutter web project:

1. **Go to the `flutterin\cache` directory**  
   Navigate to the `flutterin\cache` folder in your project. Inside this folder, youâ€™ll need to locate and delete a file named `flutter_tools.stamp`.

2. **Edit the Chrome configuration for web**  
   Next, go to `flutter\packageslutter_tools\lib\src\web` and open the file `chrome.dart`.

3. **Locate the Chrome flags**  
   In the `chrome.dart` file, search for the line that includes the Chrome flags `--disable-extensions`. This line specifies Chrome's behavior during Flutter web development.

4. **Add the necessary CORS flag**  
   To enable CORS support, add the flag `--disable-web-security` in the same line. This flag disables web security features, such as CORS checks, which are necessary when interacting with Firebase services from your Flutter web app.

   The updated line will look like this:
   ```dart
   --disable-extensions --disable-web-security
   ```

### 5. Run the App
Now, start the app on an emulator or device:

```
flutter run
```

Your app should now be set up and connected to Firebase!
